			<p>		I was born on November 22, 1994 in a small town in Western Washington called South Bend. There I went to South Bend High School and participated in track, volleyball, cheerleading, drama club, pep club and key club. I also did running start at a local community college called Grays Harbor College. <a href="https://plus.google.com/115736702946380115430/posts/aLMQYsUxB6P">My Family</a> has always been an important part of my life. I worked throughout high school at my step family&rsquo;s company <a href="http://goosepoint.com">Nisbet Oyster Co., Inc</a> in retail and labor. Living in a small town my whole life is all the more reason why I have big dreams.</p>

		<p>		I have always been one to plan ahead in life. But the truth is you will always change your mind. Just last year I believed I was going to go to school for pharmacy, but success isn&rsquo;t all about money. 
		I chose to be a journalist so I don&rsquo;t have to stand behind a counter all day. I want to go out and learn new things and do something new every day and communicate with people. I want to understand people and what&rsquo;s happening in our world in a different perspective. My decision to minor in Visual Communication Design is because of my personal interest in computer technology and to be able to adapt to this technology generation and use it to my advantage.</p>
		<p>		After graduation I would either like to join the Peace Corp and then go to graduate school for broadcasting in New York, where I&rsquo;d like to live in the future. Or just go straight to graduate school.
		Why broadcasting? My favorite part of journalism through my experiences in classes here at Eastern and on &ldquo;The Easterner&rdquo; student newspaper, is although I love to write, my favorite part is simply interviewing and communicating with my interviewees. I like to make people feel comfortable and make sure that their even having fun talking to me. I&rsquo;ve realized that that&rsquo;s not how an interview is supposed to go in the newspaper world, so I&rsquo;m having to hold back that temptation in the mean time. But in broadcast, I get to do just that! I would love to do live interviews or talk about subjects with other news peers and have fun with it!</p>
		<p>		To work for &ldquo;The Daily Show&rdquo;, &ldquo;Evening Magazine&rdquo; or something of that sort would be a dream job to me. </p>
